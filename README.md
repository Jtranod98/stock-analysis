# Stock-Analysis using VBA

## Overview of Project

To determine which stock performed well and which did not by analyze a set of stocks data and output the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock. 

### Purpose

To make the code more effecient by refactoring Module 2 solution code to do fewer steps. Using skills learned: create variable with its data types, logical and comparison operators, use index to access data in an array, for loops, if-then statements, reuse code, formatting, conditional formatting, and measure code performance.  


## Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

### Analysis of stock performance 2018

Most stocks in 2018 are in negative territory, except two.  

### Analysis of stock performance 2017

Most stocks in 2017 are in positive territory, except one

### Execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

The run time of the refactored script was 0.10 seconds compared to the original script of 0.6 seconds.  The refactored Script is much more efficient!



## Summary:

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
  The advantage of refactoring code is time saving because we don't have to start a project all over.  
	The disadvantage is that when you change or add a new variable to the code it can get very confusing where to place the new variable in the code. 

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

  It was a blessing that I didn't have to start the project from scratch, which would have taken a lot of time.  However, it was frustrating because I kept getting compiling errors.
